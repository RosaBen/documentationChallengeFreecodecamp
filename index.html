        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
        <p>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.</p>
        <p>Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.</p>
        <p>In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>
        <code>
            <p> alert( 'Hello, world!' ); </p>
        </code>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.</li>
            <li>Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.</li>
            <li>There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language.</p>
        <p>Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems.</p>
        <code>
            <p> public class HelloWorld { </p>
            <p> public static void main(String[] args) { </p>
            <p> System.out.println("Hello, World!"); </p>
            <p> } </p>
            <p> } </p>
        </code>
        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <p>There were five primary goals in creating the Java language: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
            <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
            <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
            <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
            <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
        </ol>

      <header>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and simplicity.</p>
        <p>It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Python’s vast ecosystem of libraries makes it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike.</p>
        <code>
            <p> print("Hello, World!") </p>
        </code>
        <h3>Key Points About Python: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to learn &amp; use – Simple syntax, beginner-friendly</li>
            <li>Interpreted &amp dynamically typed – No need for compilation, flexible coding</li>
            <li>Multi-purpose – Used in web development, AI, data science, automation, etc.</li>
            <li>Extensive libraries – NumPy, TensorFlow, Pandas, Django, etc.</li>
            <li>Cross-platform – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.</li>
            <li>Large community – Strong support and resources available</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Rust">
      <header>
        <h2>Rust</h2>
        <p>Rust is a high-performance and memory-safe programming language designed to prevent common memory errors found in C/C++.</p>
        <p>It is widely used in system development, embedded programming, and applications requiring high performance. Its memory management model, without a garbage collector, makes it ideal for critical software.</p>
        <code>
            <p> fn main() { </p>
            <p> println!("Hello, World!"); </p>
            <p> } </p>
        </code>

        <h3>Key Points About Rust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory safety – Prevents memory leaks and errors without a garbage collector</li>
            <li>High performance – As fast as C/C++</li>
            <li>Ownership &amp Borrowing – Strict memory management to avoid errors</li>
            <li>Safe concurrency – Facilitates parallel programming without data races</li>
            <li>Rich ecosystem – Cargo (package manager), Crates.io (libraries)</li>
            <li>Interoperability – Can integrate with C and WebAssembly</li>
            <li>Reliability – Used in critical systems (OS, blockchain, browsers)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Angular</h2>
        <p>ngular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework for building dynamic web applications.</p>
        <p>Developed and maintained by Google, it provides a powerful ecosystem for developing scalable and maintainable single-page applications (SPAs).</p>
        <code>
            <p> import { Component } from '@angular/core'; </p>
            <p> @Component({ </p>
            <p> selector: 'app-root', </p>
            <p> template: '<h2>Hello, World!</h2>' </p>
            <p> }) </p>
            <p> export class AppComponent { } </p>
        </code>
